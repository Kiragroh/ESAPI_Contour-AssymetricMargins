# ESAPI_Contour-AsymmetricMargins
(BinaryPlugin)
AutoContour specifc structures with asymmetric or symmetric margins

First-Compile tips:
- add your own ESAPI-DLL-Files (VMS.TPS.Common.Model.API.dll + VMS.TPS.Common.Model.Types). Usually found in C:\Program Files\Varian\RTM\15.1\esapi\API
- For clinical Mode: Approve the produced .dll in External Treatment Planning if 'Is Writeable = true'

Note:
- script is optimized to work with Eclipse 15.1
- absolute ESAPI-beginner should first look at my GettingStartedMaterial (collection of many helpful stuff from me or others and even includes a PDF version of some ESAPI-OnlineHelps)
